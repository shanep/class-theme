            This reading assignment is worth {{page.points}} points. The due date is listed on the <a
            href="{{site.url}}#homework">course homepage.</a> Your grade will be calculated with the
            formula: <strong>Math.floor(%complete * {{page.points}}) = Total Points</strong>. For example, if you completed 80% of
            the assigned challenge and participation questions your grade would be <strong>.8 * {{page.points}} =
            {{0.8 | times: page.points | floor }}.</strong>
