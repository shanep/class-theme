<h2 id="points">Grading</h2>

<p>
    This lab is worth {{page.points}} points. The due date is listed on the <a
    href="{{site.url}}#homework">course homepage.</a> Your grade will be calculated with the
    formula: <strong>Math.floor(%tests_passed * {{page.points}}) = Total Points</strong>. For
    example, if you passed 80% of the test suite your grade would be
    <strong>.8 * {{page.points}} = {{0.8 | times: page.points | floor }}.</strong>
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        If you program fails to compile it will be awarded 0 points. Absolutely no partial credit
        will be given if your program does not compile.
    </li>
    <li>
        Your code will be graded on the command line using the operating system and tools specified. Your instructor
        will not use an IDE to build your lab.
    </li>

        Do not modify files that say <strong>DO NOT MODIFY</strong>. If you do you will be awarded 0
        points!
