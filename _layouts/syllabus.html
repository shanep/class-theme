    <h3 id="can-i-still-pass">Can I still pass?</h3>

    <p>
        The passing grade for courses in the Computer Science Department is 70%. So we can calculate the
        absolute minimum number of points that you need to earn in this course as {{total_points |
        times: 70 | divided_by: 100 | plus: 1}}. To know if you still can pass the course all you need
        to do is take your current grade and then add in any points that you could still earn before the
        end of the semester. If that number is below {{total_points | times: 70 | divided_by: 100 |
        plus: 1}} then it is not mathematically possible for you to pass the class.
    </p>

    <h3 id="incomplete">Incomplete</h3>

    <p>
        Instructors can enter a grade of I—for incomplete—if both of the following conditions are present:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            You have completed either 80% of the course or 80% of the coursework.
        </li>
        <li>
            Extenuating circumstances make it impossible for you to complete the course before the end of the semester.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Be aware that the University considers an extenuating circumstance to be along the lines of "I
        was in the hospital for the last 2 weeks in a coma". More information can be found on the
        <a href="https://www.boisestate.edu/registrar/degree-requirements/grades/">registrar's</a> page.

    <h2 id="institutional-policies">Institutional Policies</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
        Please review the <a
            href="https://www.boisestate.edu/registrar/general-information-and-policies/academic-integrity/">
            academic-integrity</a> policy set by the university. Violations of this policy will result in the student
        receiving a failing grade (F) for the course.</li>
        <li>
        It is expected that all students <a
            href="https://www.boisestate.edu/policy/student-affairs/code-of-conduct/">read</a>
        and follow the University policy 2020. Any violation of University policy 2020 can result in the
        student being removed from the class discussion and study groups. The students' participation score
        will be set to 0 and no alternative assignment will be given. Egregious behavior will be reported
        to the <a href="https://www.boisestate.edu/deanofstudents/student-conduct-report-form/">dean of students</a>
        for additional sanctions which can include receiving a failing grade (F) in the course.

    <h2 id="academic-honesty">Academic Honesty Policy</h2>

    <p>
        Programming assignments require the implementation of working programs using the language
        constructs and techniques introduced in class. Programs must execute and compile on the operating
        system and compiler specified.  Students are expected to work on their own unless explicitly
        instructed otherwise.  Students who allow their work to be copied will be written up along with
        the student who copied. Cheating is grounds for immediate failure of the course. This includes
        trying to find answers to problems, programs, exams or providing (directly or indirectly)
        your completed assignments to other students. Uploading solutions to sites such as 
        <a href="https://chegg.com">cheeg.com</a> is also considered an academic honesty violation and
        will be reported to the dean of students.
    </p>

    <p>
        Boise State promotes Academic Excellence as a core Shared Value upholding the virtue of honesty in
        the pursuit of knowledge. Behaving with integrity and honesty is a hallmark of a Boise State
        University graduate. The conferring of a degree represents the University's indication that the
        recipient has engaged in academic work that is representative of her/his own efforts and that was
        completed with integrity and honesty.
    </p>
    <p>
        Upholding academic integrity in all assignments provides students with the opportunity to engage
        with the material being investigated and assert their evidence based findings. This behavior
        demonstrates the commitment to learning and preparation necessary for a successful future. All
        work you submit must represent your own ideas and effort or be cited including any material you
        wrote for another course; when work does not, it is academic dishonesty. <strong>Academic
        dishonesty in any form may result in failure in the course or dismissal from the Program and/or
        the University.</strong> 
    </p>


    <h2 id="late-work-policy">Late Work Policy</h2>

    <p>
        All assignments can be submitted up to <strong>3 days late without penalty</strong>, after 3 days
        past the due date absolutely no work will be accepted under any circumstances.  No work will be
        accepted after the <strong>last day of course instruction</strong>, the semester has to end at
        some point so plan accordingly.  Work submitted 1 second late is treated the same as work
        submitted 1 day late. You can find the last day of course instruction at
        the <a href="https://www.boisestate.edu/registrar/boise-state-academic-calendars/">registrar</a>.
        Plenty of extra credit is offered to offset any missed assignment(s).
    </p>

    <h2 id="email-policy">Email Policy</h2>

    <p>
        BroncoMail is the official communication channel through which all university business is
        conducted. It is expected that you access and read university communications two or three
        times per week. For more information see the University Policy on Student Email
        Communications <a
        href="https://www.boisestate.edu/policy/student-affairs/policy-title-student-e-mail-communications/">(Policy
        2280).</a> <strong>Your instructor will not respond to any emails sent from personal
        accounts such as Gmail or Yahoo.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        Your instructor will make every effort to return emails within 48hrs Monday thru Friday between
        the hours of 9:00am and 5:00pm (MST). Emails sent on Saturday, Sunday, or outside of the defined
        hours will be returned within 48hrs on the following business day. Emails should be reserved for
        questions that are not appropriate for a public forum such as grades or other personal issues. If
        you don't receive a response from your instructor after 48hrs please check to make sure you are
        sending the email from BroncoMail and send a follow-up email.
    </p>

    <h2 id="discussion-board">Discussion Board</h2>

    <p>
        We will be using an online discussion board for this course. Rather than emailing questions to me, please post your
        questions on the discussion board and get replies from myself as well as your classmates! You can also post private
        messages to me. You are expected to log onto the board at least once a week and read all the posts.
    </p>

    <h2 id="attendance-policy">Attendance Policy</h2>

    <p>
        There is no grade associated with attending class. However, if the behavior of a student impacts
        other students ability to learn there could be an impact to your final grade. It is the student's
        responsibility to make up any work missed during class within the prescribed late work policy
        window. 
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Don't come into class sick!</strong> There is no reason to come to class sick under any
        circumstances. Most of the material is available online either in video or text format so you
        can easily catch up on anything that you may have missed in class!
    </p>


    <h2 id="computer-lab">Computer Lab </h2>

    <p>
        Standing extra credit is always offered to allow students to bump their grade up if they are on a
        grading boundary so please take advantage of any extra credit offered. Any extra credit given over
        the semester can not exceed 2.5% of the total points offered. For example, the maximum number of
        extra credit points that you can earn if the total points offered is 1000 would be 25.
