## Overview

When you write code problems will happen! There is a lot of stuff that is outside of your control
such as what the operating system does, the state of the network, or using other engineers code.
Java has exceptions built into the language to help solve these issues. When your code gets into an
unknown state you can throw an exception! When you used other code you may have to catch and
exception. Proper exception handling will make the difference between a robust application that will
be easy to maintain and a flaky application that is constantly crashing.

## Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Describe exception handling in Java
- Understand the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions.
- Identify common paradigms that will cause an exceptions (file access, network, etc.)
- Write exception safe code
- Apply using the try/catch keywords
