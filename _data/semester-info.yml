   Welcome to the class! My name is Shane Panter and I will be your instructor for this course. For
   many students this will be the first time you have been exposed to Web Development of any kind.
   This course has been designed to take someone who has never seen these concepts before to being
   able to produce an interactive website in 16 weeks. This class is a three credit course and it is
   specifically designed to require 8 to 10 hours of work each week. In order to succeed in the
   course, it will be critical for you to manage your time effectively and keep up with the reading
   and lab activities.  Please take some time to get familiar with the course website. Pay close
   attention when when the homework assignments are due to ensure you get everything in on time.
   <br><br> We will be interacting with each other primarily through github, discussion forums, and
   videos. Get started by completing the Course Introduction homework below!
